# Lab 44 - Open Source Contribution

## Root Cause Analysis
1. Repo owner had an open issue for quote submissions for a random quote php library
2. Submissions could be made by forking the repo
3. Jokes are held in a JSON file in the /config folder of repo
2. I added a couple jokes as new lines to the JSON file
1. I pushed to my fork, and created a repo back to the owner's "quote-submission" branch per their instructions.
