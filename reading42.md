**Explain why tests are important. Please explain as though I were your non technical elder.**

Testing your code is important because you write it to perform a certain function, but code tests allow you to verify that, and see if it breaks under conditions it wasn't designed for.

**What are three expected benefits of testing**

- Reduction in defect rates
- Reduction in effort in the final project phases
- Veteran TDD programmers assert that it produces higher quality code

**Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.**

- Individuals can forget to run tests
- Individuals can write too many tests
- Team may only partially adopt TDD
- Team may not keep the test suite up to date

**What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?**

- Faster release times
- Easier maintenance
- Easier to isolate faults

**What is the difference between Continuos Delivery and Continuous Deployment?**

Continuous delivery - software is always ready for release with approvals. Continuous deployment - software is always automatically deploying changes to production

**Explain how GitHub fits into this process assuming the listener comes from a non-technical background**
