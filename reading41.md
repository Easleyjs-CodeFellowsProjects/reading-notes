# Reading Notes (401) Reading 01 - easleyjs

-- Class Exercise
**How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**

Node is kind of a sandbox for running Javascript code on the server. Node can serve web apps and data, connect to databases, and manipulate data/files on the server.

**What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**

Node runs Javascript the same way a browser would, so it doesn't require a special version of the language or a special compile process.

**What is Node used for?**

To run JS on a server, provide a way to develop desktop apps, and to serve web apps and data.

**Looking ahead at this moduleâ€™s course schedule, What do you look forward to learning?**

Definitely looking forward to implementing data structures in JS

**What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?**

Honestly, looking forward to learning how to develop unit tests for Node/Express apps.

## Things I want to know more about

Interested in if there's overlap Github Actions and Github repo rules - such as if you can control deployments based on whether certain tests pass or have similar logic in there
