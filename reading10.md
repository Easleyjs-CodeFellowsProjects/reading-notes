| SQL      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Table-based data      | Graph, document, or wide-column store data |
| Databases are structured | DBs have no implicit structure |
| Uses SQL for queries | Uses UnSQL |
| Good for complex queries | Not good for complex queries |
| Not good for hierarchical data | Very good for hierarchical data |

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**

Non-hierarchical, transactional

**Give a real world example.**

Sales data for an online store

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**

Hierarchical data, where ATOMicity isn't as important, large data sets
